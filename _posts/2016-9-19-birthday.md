Thirty days hath September <br>
for as long as I remember <br>
until next year, at thirty one,<br>
What things may duly come? <br>

My preponderance prodded at the Dish, <br>
why Vanessasaur, what do you wish? <br>
Thoughts climbing slopes, far up and down <br>
from the foothills side, back toward town. <br>

First came hopes, lithe and fun! <br>
Always starting and never done <br>
Always gaining and never won <br>
Should I quicker jump, or faster run? <br>

Followed by fears, meek and shy <br>
Sometimes cunning, never spry <br>
Religiously truthful, will not lie <br>
Can I evade darkness before I die? <br>

Quick in tow was love and heart <br>
Forever caring, emotionally smart <br>
Always defeated yet finding start <br>
Might I surpass ego to play my part? <br>

Last came dream, fickle and sweet, <br>
Traversing muddy forest, stinky feet! <br>
Falling constantly, never to defeat <br>
Will I traverse mountains, promises keep? <br>

I thought long and hard <br>
about what I might expect <br>
I imagined every card, <br>
that fate keeps in her deck <br>

Thirty years this September <br>
that's as long as I remember <br>
For future passed and what may come <br>
Ask me when I'm thirty one :) <br>
